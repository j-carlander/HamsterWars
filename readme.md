# Express Server - Exercise

Create a hamsterwars page where you can vote for which hamster is sweeter out of two hamsters.

The page consists of two pictures where you can choose one or the other as the cutest. When a hamster is selected, the answer is sent to the server where the data is saved.

All hamster voting must be available via an endpoint (GET) /result.
